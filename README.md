# File Manager
Project Overview
This project is a simple remote file manager akin to a Google Drive. The client is a command line interface that allows users to upload, download and manage files on the remote server.

Upon successful connection to a server, the client allows users to:

- Navigate to a folder - `cd <folder name>`
- List the current folder's content `ls`
- Create new folders `mkdir <folder name>`
- Upload files to the server `upload <filename>`
-  Dowload files from the server `download <filename>`
- Disconnect from the server `exit`
	
Built using Java with the Eclipse IDE.
